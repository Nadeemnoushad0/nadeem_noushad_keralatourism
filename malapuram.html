            <h2 class="center padding">Malappuram</h2>

            <p class="center padding">Malappuram is one of the 14 districts in the Indian state of Kerala, with a coastline of 70 km (43 mi). It is the most populous district of Kerala, which is home to around 13% of the total population of the state. The district was formed on
                16 June 1969, spanning an area of about 3,554 km2 (1,372 sq mi). It is the third-largest district of Kerala by area. It is also the largest district of Kerala bounded by Western Ghats and Arabian Sea on the eastern and the western borders
                respectively. It is the third major contributing district to the Gross State Domestic Product of Kerala as of 2019, after Ernakulam and Thiruvananthapuram. The eastern part of the district is hilly and the western part is coastal region.
                Eranad, Kondotty, Nilambur, Perinthalmanna, Ponnani, Tirur, and Tirurangadi, are the seven subdistricts (Taluks) included in the district. Malayalam is the most spoken language. Religions practised in the district include Islam, Hinduism,
                and Christianity. The district has witnessed significant emigration, especially to the Arab states of the Persian Gulf during the Gulf Boom of the 1970s and early 1980s, and its economy depends significantly on remittances from a large
                Malayali expatriate community. It was the first e-literate district and the first cyber literate district of India. Malappuram metropolitan area is the fourth-largest urban agglomeration of Kerala and the 25th largest of India with a population
                of 1.7 million. 44.2% of the district's population reside in the urban areas according to the 2011 census of India. Malappuram was the headquarters of the British troops in the erstwhile Malabar District during British Raj. Malappuram
                was also one of the five divisions of the British Malabar district, along with Thalassery, Kozhikode, Palakkad, and Fort Cochin divisions. The port town of Ponnani was one of the major ports in the Malabar Coast during the medieval period.[20]
                During the early medieval period, the district was home to two of the four major kingdoms that ruled Kerala. Perumpadappu was the hometown of the Kingdom of Cochin, which is also known as Perumbadappu Swaroopam, and Nediyiruppu was the
                hometown of the Zamorin of Calicut, which is also known as Nediyiruppu Swaroopam.</p>
